# DAPNET2APRS
Simple Forwarder to Send My DAPNET Pager Messages to my APRS Devices

An ugly application that scrapes your MMDVM hotspot (or repeater MMDVM page) to obtain your pager details since DAPNET API doesn't allow you to monitor the network or incomming messages directly. At least... not without me playing with the DAPNET Gateway and forwards your pager messages over to an APRS ID via the APRS-IS network.

The purpose is simple, if I don't have my pager but I have my portable or mobile APRS radio, I'll still get my pager messages.
DAPNET has an APRS to DAPNET gateway so it's even possible to reply if I wanted to.
